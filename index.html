	<p>I'm Milton Pettus, and I'm a man with a goal. What's that goal? To see the end of bank thieves, horse snatchers, lady stunners, and other wild west do-badders.</p>

	<p>I'm the Sheriff of the west, in a small town of Albuquerque. I chase down anyone who wants to upend the law. My passion is gunslinging, heist stopping, and horse riding.</p>
