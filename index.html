		<p>My name is Milton Pettus. I was born and raised in Albuquerque, NM. My hobbies are Sports, Gaming and Movies.
			I enjoy hanging out with friends and family and eating a good meal.</p>
		<p>I'm new to the world of IT/coding. I hope after this coding boot camp I'm prepared to get a job in this field.  </p>
